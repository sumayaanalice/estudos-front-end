# Study repository.

This repository is where I put in all notes that I made, pratice exercise and project build on Origamid for developer front-end course.
I'm learning a lot not only the code part, but also practing more the git versioning, using sill more the github and learning to create projects docs.

This README will change as progress on course to practice of creacion docs.
